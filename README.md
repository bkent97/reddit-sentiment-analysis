Using Python's Natural Language Tool Kit, I developed a program to analyze the sentiment of incoming Reddit comments. To do this I use 7 different Naive Bayes algorithms to 'vote' on the sentiment of an input. First, I train them with 5000 different positive movie reviews and 5000 different negative movie reviews. After training, I create a stream of comments filtered by designated keywords taken from Reddit and feed these in to the program. If at least 6 of the 7 algorithms agree on either a positive or negative sentiment then I would use that data to construct a live graph. This allowed me to create visualizations of Reddit's opinion on various topics in real time.
